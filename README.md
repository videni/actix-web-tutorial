rust web development experiment
===============================

I'm evaluating web development on rust, this is very opinioned seletions.

## Requirements

* actix-web
* Postgresql
  
## Features 

* [x] Follow DDD patterns
* [x] Integration test sample
* [x] Using Postgresql instead of MySQL
  
  Sorry I don't use MySQL, uuid is internally handled by Postgresql, I need a way to create the id for an entity before persisting it into database.
* Rollback after integration test
* Repository for database operations
* Model for business logic
* JWT Authentication
* Integrate GraphQL

## Getting started

* Create .env

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

* Install diesel cli with mysql

```bash
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres
diesel setup
```

* Setup your database

```bash
  diesel database setup
```

* Build this project with `cargo build`. You are welcome to compile with `--release` if you'd like.
* Run with `cargo run`.
  
## Test

```bash
cp .env.example .env.test
```

then run all tests

```
cargo test
```

You can also run specific test

```
cargo test test_login
```

For local development, you usually want to print something into std output, 
then you can run your test this way 
```
cargo test test_login -- --nocapture
```
check  [`--nocapture`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html) for details.
